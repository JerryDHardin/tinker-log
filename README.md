Tinker-log

A running record of experiments, builds, fixes, and system tinkering — updated in batches rather than on a strict schedule.

December 2025
Projects & Experiments

Set up the retired gaming rig as a Jellyfin/Plex home server; planned automated file-sync workflow between main workstation and server using mapped network shares and possible Syncthing rules.

Investigated ultra-compact USB-C SSD stick failures — documented floating-port cradle issue common across OEM enclosures after teardown.

ThreadedMind development: finalized platform priorities (site → YouTube → Substack), noted Discord as a potential future “afterspace” rather than a launch tool.

Archival, Logs & Coding

Continued filtering ChatGPT logs for the MyChat archive; refined directory structure and index-page behavior.

Revisited Wmcy’s orchestrator and data-interpretation plans for future 5.x iterations.

November 2025
Systems & Networking

Maintained Kali dual-boot setup; tested Alfa AWUS036ACS, monitor mode, and packet capturing; experimented with isolating home network tests using GL-iNet router as a buffer.

Recovered and sorted older backup content (MAME/emulator libraries, project folders).

Compared construction quality of compact 1TB USB-C SSD sticks (Zheino/KingSpec/Netac); noted design weaknesses and teardown differences.

Weave / ThreadedMind Updates

Revised index-page flow, banner sizing, and root CSS variables for a stable site-wide aesthetic.

Expanded ARG and lore notes: daemon behavior, LLM-side perspective logs, long-arc mythos triggers.

October 2025
Hardware & Software Maintenance

Reorganized drives across Phobos/Cronus for VR, Steam library, and local-LLM workloads.

Benchmarked GGUF quantizations (Q4_K_M vs. Q5_K_M) to measure VRAM efficiency on the 3060 12GB.

Refined Obsidian dashboard structure and log aggregation for better daily/weekly workflows.

Creative & Community Exploration

Tested writing and social channels on Discord; evaluated potential use for a small Weave-focused community later in development.

Brainstormed Wmcy avatar HUD concepts, pixel-cloud status widgets, and lightweight VRAM/LLM-load visualizers.

September 2025
Software & Media Automation

Streamlined Firestick setup: removed bloatware, preserved Stremio/VLC from idle-kill, calibrated subtitles.

Built autonomous media-gathering pipeline using Stremio + Prowlarr with multi-indexer integration and Sonarr/Radarr sync; tested workflow using Severance.

August 2025
Portfolio & Repo Work

Uploaded major projects (Wmcy, Icepickv2, basicCalculator) to GitHub; updated résumé with GitHub link to establish a public dev footprint.

Reorganized Wmcy’s internal structure and repo layout for future portfolio readability.

Game Dev & Local AI

Refactored blob logic in the Icepick React engine, focusing on random side-drop collisions and prep for debug overlays.

Balanced health routine with coding practice; continued experimenting with Stable Diffusion (A1111) for concept art and aesthetic prototyping.
